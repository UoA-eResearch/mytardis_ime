Restrict access to your data
============================
In the Instrument Data Wizard, you can define which users or groups of users have access to your data in the |service_name|. 

|service_name| has a cascading access control mechanism which allows you to apply restrictions on which users or groups of users can access a file or a group of files. Permissions granted at a higher level of the hierarchy will cascade down to all the files nested in it unless explicitly overriden.

Users must have an account created in |service_name| in order to access the data.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    
    Think about who needs to be able to access your data. What kind of access should they have? If there's a subset of the data that should be accessible to more or fewer people, how should they be organised?
