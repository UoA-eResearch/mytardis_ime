Export your metadata
====================
Once you are happy with the metadata, you can save it again. 

We are finished! When your data is copied and ingested into |service_name|, the metadata file will be examined for a list of data files, how they should be structured, metadata associated with them, and access control properties. If there are any errors or validation problems in the process, you will be notified.
