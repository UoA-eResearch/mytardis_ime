Creating a data dictionary
------------------------
By creating a `data dictionary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary>`_, you can clarify what metadata you need to collect for your data. It can also help you record `Parameter` names and values consistently, using the same letter casing and units. This will help with finding your data in the future. 

For example, if you have a Parameter representing a length, decide on the name (e.g. "distance", no uppercase) and the value unit (e.g. millimetre), and use them consistently.
