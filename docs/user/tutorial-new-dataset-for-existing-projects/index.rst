Tutorial: Annotating your new dataset for existing projects
#############################################################

Welcome to our tutorial! Here, we'll guide you through the process of annotating a dataset using the Instrument Data Wizard, getting it ready for ingestion into |service_name|.

Imagine yourself in a fictional scenario: You're Sarah, a PhD student collecting data for your cancer genomics research, and you would like to store that data in your University's instrument data repository.

In this tutorial, we'll provide step-by-step instructions to help you annotate your dataset effectively by **using a template YAML file downloaded from Instrument Data Service for existing projects**.
