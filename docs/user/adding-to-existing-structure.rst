Adding data to existing Projects, Experiments or Datasets in the data repository
=================================================================================

To access your existing Projects, Experiments, and Datasets in |service_name|, we need to first create a YAML file that will be used for the connection. This YAML file will contain the necessary information to connect to the service and list your projects.

* Log in to the `Instrument Data Service <https://instruments.nectar.auckland.ac.nz/>`_ with 2 factor auth (2FA).
* Point to this `download link <https://test-instruments.nectar.auckland.ac.nz/yaml/idw-yaml>`_. You will get a Template 'ingestion.yaml' dowloaded.
* Open the Wizard and click the `Open` button, select the downloaded YAML file, and click `Open`. Your projects from |service_name| will be listed.
* You can start adding data to the existing projects, experiments or datasets in the Wizard, by following :ref:`Add more data <add-more-data>`.
