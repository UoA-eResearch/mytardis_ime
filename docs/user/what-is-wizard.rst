##################################################

At |institution_name|, |service_name| is the place to store your research data from scientific instruments.

Instrument Data Wizard is a metadata editor for files being ingested into MyTardis. It is a tool for adding metadata to your data files, preparing the YAML file for ingestion into MyTardis. The metadata you add will be stored in the |service_name| database and will be searchable by you and others.
